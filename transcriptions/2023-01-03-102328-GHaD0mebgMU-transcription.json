number to come out at 9 45 and I was expecting it to likely whip up into that and then look for a sell-off and I tweeted about that this morning as a potential scenario we were waiting for 9 45 News not just simply waiting for 9 30 opening\n \nthank you this old high here why this one is the highest one in the range from today's opening looking back here you go this is the first one you go to that would be higher than this one and before we get this volume in balance so we're stuck essentially inside this range waiting for it to come out of that so we can obviously trade inside this range as you watch me the other day but it takes a little bit more patience so we can drop down into the 60 Minute chart all right here is the one hour chart you can see how we did not get up into that employment balance on daily chart we swap the buy sell liquidity twice once twice broke down if everybody got salsa liquidity and the 30 minute whatever you got so notice we have this big run here but if we drop down into a 30 minute chart now I use the 30 minute chart because you can clearly see that imbalance right there\n \nso failure to get up above this High here and run for that that's what we were waiting for confirmation one way or the other if it was going to run there not in a hurry to take a trade first trading day of the year everybody's going to be wanting to get in there and do something right away we have a fair value Gap there and you can see all those tweets were mentioned before the fact and then I mentioned that we would draw down likely into this area here so let's go into a 15 minute\n \nokay and very clear 15 minute time frame fair value Gap beautiful return into it repricing and then lower down to a nice start of 30 14 and a half five minute chart\n \nMarket trades above again where the buy side is nice round number 3 900. there breaks lower this low here we're going to look at that on a one minute chart all right on the one minute chart you can see we had a run up into where buysite is Market breaks down takes out swing low now why do I like this low it may be something like this one not so much well you could have used this one here where we went below it right on that candle then we trade it right up inside this imbalance there that's more or less a institutional overflow entry drill it breaks lower really changes the market structure here and over here so this is going to be a little bit more of a quality type setup to have a fair value Gap in here as it traded up into that that's an expectation of lower prices because this is also a breaker bearish ICT breaker okay so inside this lathdown close candle it's returning back up into notice the bodies of the candle they're respecting half of that range from the candles high and low that right there is mean threshold mean threshold is half of an order block ing breaks lower creates another imbalance repair of a gap from this candle is high that candle is low and that shaded area in here\n \nso I'm going to take these off as I talk about them because it's no longer important and we have the up close candles here once we break through it it's a bearish order block and institutional Oracle entry drill and a fair value Gap so there's lots of confirmation for wanting to be a short seller here on this candle as we trade up into it and trade lower leaving that open okay leaving this range here open is what Breakaway got okay the market trades lower into our survey gap on the 15-minute time frame it consolidates I go short one more time and accelerates down into\n \nthe 30 minute fair value Gap here and as we went down below it limit order was filled and then we retrace all the way back up to a perfect return to the 15 minute fair value Gap look at the Precision there now go back and look over here do you see any kind of classic support resistance that would justify that perfect Precision right there no but the algorithm does and sees the fair value Gap that I've outlined on the 15-minute time frame that's real support and resistance folks the market trades lower down into the low end of our 30 minute fair value Gap beautiful delivery and I more or less told you all to screenshot it on your own chart not just simply take my charts because it's that's a lazy person's approach to doing it you won't learn that way you want to get in here and get comfortable marking your charts up it takes a little bit of effort takes time and it's important for you to be able to do it and if you don't do it if you don't like doing it I promise you trading won't be a successful Endeavor for you you have to be involved you have to do it yourself and it requires a lot of effort on part of the students Market hangs around Works inside one more time consequent encouragement which is the middle of an imbalance mean threshold is the middle of a order block consequent encroachment is the middle of a gap okay or an inefficiency like a fair value Gap by sound of balance outside efficiency or South side imbalance by sound efficiency either or just write that down because we'll build on that as we go forward in the mentorship but it goes halfway up into that and then clears the buy side cell size below here attack it runs down to a really beautiful Turning Point 30 14 and a half and then now we've returned back up into that 30 minute fair value Gap and now consolidating in around and working the top end of that 30 minute figure that you got so we'll be looking to see an eventual breakout of not that I'm a breakout Trader but we want to see a break out of that daily range before my interest has really peaked on any sustainable price run for analysis purposes otherwise in layman's terms in Easy language we have to be an intraday scalper until there's a higher time frame daily narrative at work so that way everything we look for is on a small time frame and not expecting big monster moves all right so we're watching price this morning uh first trading day of the year I went short on two fair value gaps and one at the top of the orange Fairway Gap at 38.60 looking for continuation down into the levels I shared on Twitter initially I thought that we would get 39.20 as a run-up aggressive run as a Judas swing like a fake rally aggressive during the PMI numbers at 9 45 uh Marco was not having that so that's why I said we have to wait and see what the market does it failed to run above the 39.05 level so I waited for the shift in Market structure at just below 38.72 and 3 4 73 and then return back into a fair value guide you can see the entries on the left-hand side on that one minute chart broke down traded again on a short entry into the fair that I got and also very shorter block and the third entry is at the top of the orange purvey Gap at 38.60 as it traded up into that looking for heaviness going down into the 38 39 and a quarter level so I took one partial\n \nleaving two contracts on and I want to get below that 38 42 50 level that's where sell side is you can see that noted on the right hand side on a 30 minute chart and then why am I using a 30 minute chart I want to see price remain below that pair of a gap here on the left hand side if it goes above that then I'll probably have to want to close the trades when I'm thinking but I want to see it remain heavy heavy means I want to see it Go lower and have difficulty rallying higher and if we trade down below 38 42.50 I will take one off but rejecting that 38 I'm sorry 3920 level like I was expecting that daily volume balance up there right hand side chart the upper orange level uh that to me was a likelihood of a draw on the news driver okay but I'll take another partial off here and we'll see if it wants to go down and take that I I mean a low hanging fruit objective now and we'll see if we get that\n \nboom","offsetMS":"0","durationMS":"2000"}
